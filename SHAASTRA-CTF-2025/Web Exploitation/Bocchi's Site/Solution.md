Inspect The Home page, You will find the hidden message "Follow Hitori"

 So, go to Hitori Gotoh Page and if you inspect there you will find a msg that stated "VTJoaFlYTjBjbUY3WDJKdlkyTm9hVjg9,follow kita" .May be the first part is a flag and looks 
 
like base64 encoded, which on decoding gives "Shaastra{_bocchi_" and if we follow kita, inspect it where you will find 2nd part which is also base64 encoded and follow ryo. Follow 

the same process for all parts and You will find the flag
	
Shaastra{_bocchi__kita-chan__ryo_!yamada__seika!!}

(In the flag,the word bocchi has underscore before and after it. text editor is showing it as italic font)
