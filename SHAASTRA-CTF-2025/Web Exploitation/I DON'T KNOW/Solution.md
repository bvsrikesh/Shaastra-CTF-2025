If we go to the register page and register there with the required details and it directs you to an otp page.

But for given mail, any otp doesn't show up and even if give incorrect mail, it still asks for otp. Hence, we have to bypass this otp page. 

If we intercept the request using burp site, and remove the Otp details, such as otp and content length and send the request to server, We will get the return flag.
