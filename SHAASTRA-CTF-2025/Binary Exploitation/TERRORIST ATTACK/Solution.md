If we run the binary file 

./NATIONAL_SECURITY

There are three options to see the credentials, Enter the User_id, and login.

And in function Login we see that the flag is printed if the key value is equal to "mana".

and in function User scanf gives us the vunerability to change the value of key as it doesn't check the boundary of the input.

So lets see the credentials

![Picture1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8d95be6-8824-4f83-a700-a872820aa001)

 We see that the difference between addresses are 0x20(32 bytes).
 
So we fill the 32 bytes with thrash and append "mana" at end.

That changes key value to "mana".

Now using login (3) we can access the flag

echo -e "2\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmana\n3\n" | ./NATIONAL_SECURITY

Here \n acts as enter .

The password is 20013014994 

Now opening the zip with the password above gives us the flag .

Shaastra{A77ACK_0N_K@$M!R}
